## React Overview ##

<br>The React project is contained within the 'hardware-rental' folder. 
<br>App.css describes the main styling for the page
<br>App.jsx contains the majority of the functional code and ultimately written in javaScript.
<br>index.html contains the bare-bones page layout and contains a 'root' element and a reference to the 'main.jsx' file.
<br>index.css contains styling for index.html. This defines overall styling for the whole page and <br>doesn't generally contain specific styles for elements.
<br>main.jsx binds the React app in 'App.jsx' to the 'root' element in the index.html file.
